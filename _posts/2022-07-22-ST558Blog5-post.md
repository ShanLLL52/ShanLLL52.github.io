# Code for render

``` r
rmarkdown::render("./_Rmd/2022-07-22-ST558Blog5-post.Rmd", 
          output_format = "github_document", 
          output_dir = "/Users/sl666/Desktop/ST558/ShanLLL52.github.io/_posts",
          output_options = list(
            html_preview = FALSE))
```

I think that I learned a lot about data science in this course and I
will continue to use R going forward. Becuase R is the language that I
am most familar with. Also, R is very convinent and has large user
community, which is very helpful when I use R. Now I learned more about
machine learning, especially training and test set, and knew a little
bit about database as well as shiny app, which are very interesting. I
have no idea how it may work in practice, but I believe I am more
prepared. I will probably do some practice in database and shiny app.
Before taking this course, I had experience in machine learning. After
taking this course, I want to explore more about database as well as
shiny app.
