I think being a data scientist is about gathering data, applying machine learning, predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis to extract the important information from data. I think a data scientist needs to know programming, statistics, and domain knowledge. Both data scientists and statisticians needs to have solid foundation in statistics and tend to gather informations from data. For data scientists, the amount of data is massive and need to spend a lot of time to data cleansing and transformation while for statisticians, they use traditional and small scale of methods of data collection and the amount of data is small. While data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. From what I had learned so far, I think I view myself as a statistician. I did not have too much experience in comparing different methods to create the best machine learning model. Most of experience is about finding a best model to fit the data using the statistician's way. I think I have enough knowledge about statistics and programming.
