## ST558 Second Blog Post

I used R and SAS before. I think R is more flexible compared to SAS,
which means that we can write our own packages or we can use the others’
packages. But R can be inefficient when it is dealing with big data. I
like the help function since I can check the functions without searching
documentation online. I think it’s very convenient. And sometimes I use
R as a calculator. I may miss the efficiency of the SAS since R takes a
long time when process a large data. When I first time learned R, I felt
that it is hard to find the correct function to use but overall, it is
not hard to understand or learn.

## Example

``` r
plot(cars)
```
