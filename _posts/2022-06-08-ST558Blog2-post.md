I think R is more flexible compared to SAS, which means that we can
write our own packages or we can use the others’ packages. But R can be
inefficient when it is dealling with big data. I like the help function
since I can check the functions without searching documentation online.
I think it’s very convenient. And sometimes I use R as a calculator. I
may miss the efficiency of the SAS since R takes a long time when
process a large data. When I first time learned R, I felt that it is
hard to find the correct function to use.

## Example

``` r
plot(iris)
```
